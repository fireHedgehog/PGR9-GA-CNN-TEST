# A Convolution Neural Network (CNN) From Scratch
This was written for my blog post [CNNs, Part 1: An Introduction to Convolution Neural Networks](https://victorzhou.com/blog/intro-to-cnns-part-1/).

To see Part 2 (for my sequel blog post [CNNs, Part 2: Training a Convolutional Neural Network](https://victorzhou.com/blog/intro-to-cnns-part-2/)), visit the [master](https://github.com/vzhou842/cnn-from-scratch) branch.

## Usage

Install dependencies:

```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then, run it with no arguments:

```bash
$ python cnn.py
```

You can also [run this code in your browser](https://repl.it/@vzhou842/A-CNN-from-scratch-Part-1).
